# Advent Of Code

A free-for-all repository for anyone who wants to participate in the advent of code christmas
calendar challenges.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar for nerds where a programming
puzzle is posted each day during December 1-25. All puzzles have some input that is
personalized for each user, so you'll have to log in there using your public Github, Google,
Twitter or Reddit account.

The adventofcode website also supports private leaderboards. We made one so you can all brag
about your awesomeness if you want to. Go
[here](http://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/private) and use the code `139757-81917909` to
join it.

## Access to this repo

- If you don't have write access to this repo already, then go
  [here](https://github.com/orgs/kolonialno/teams/adventofcodeteam) and request access to the
  adventofcode team
- If you see a 404, please ask on the slack channel (mentioned below), and we'll try to get
  things sorted out.

## Setup

- Make a top-level folder for yourself (or for your group if you've decided to try and solve as
  a group)
- Do as you will in there

## Manifesto

- I am the receiver of code, thy Repo
- Thou shall have fun
- Thou shalt not care about perfection of commits
- Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour's code
- Thou shall covet thy neighbours solution if thou needeth
- Thou shall manipulate thy non-participating colleague to participate

## Rules:

- Push only to your folder (and organize inside there however you want)
- Don't push branches (there's no point here since your folder is unique)
- Don't force push anywhere (you'll make life hard for everyone else)
- Don't commit anything to root (except for the folder you are going to work in)

## Community, help, discussions, questions, etc

- Use github issues and tag them with the day they are for and/or
- Join slack channel [**#adventofcode**](https://kolonialno.slack.com/archives/C01GGT5M6MN)

## Suggestion

- Mark your commit messages with something that might be useful for you if you want to easily
  search them
- Take a chance to learn that language you've wanted to dabble in this whole time :)
