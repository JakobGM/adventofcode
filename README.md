# Advent Of Code

A free-for-all repository for anyone who wants to participate in the advent of code christmas
calendar challenges.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar for nerds where a programming
puzzle is posted each day during December 1-25. All puzzles have some input that is
personalized for each user, so you'll have to log in there using your public Github, Google,
Twitter or Reddit account.

## Access to this repo

**NOTE:** This repo is (intentionally) public, so it is readable by anyone.

- If you don't have write access to this repo already, then go
  [here](https://github.com/orgs/kolonialno/teams/adventofcodeteam) and request access to the
  adventofcode team

## Setup

- Make a top-level folder for yourself (or for your group if you've decided to try and solve as
  a group)
- Do as you will in there

## Manifesto

- I am the receiver of code, thy Repo
- Thou shall have fun
- Thou shalt not care about perfection of commits
- Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour's code
- Thou shall covet thy neighbours solution if thou needeth
- Thou shall manipulate thy non-participating colleague to participate

## Rules:

- Push only to your folder (and organize inside there however you want)
- Don't push branches (there's no point here since your folder is unique)
- Don't force push anywhere (you'll make life hard for everyone else)
- Don't commit anything to root (except for the folder you are going to work in)

## Community, help, discussions, questions, etc

- Use github issues and tag them with the day they are for and/or
- Join slack channel [**#adventofcode**](https://kolonialno.slack.com/archives/C01GGT5M6MN)

## Suggestion

- Mark your commit messages with something that might be useful for you if you want to easily
  search them
- Take a chance to learn that language you've wanted to dabble in this whole time :)
